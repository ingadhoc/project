==========
Project UX
==========


Several improvements to project:

#. Change default behavior when click on the project card in the kanban view, now will go to the project form view instead of the project task kanban view.
#. Add a boolean toggle button called "DonÂ´t send stage email" that gives the user the chance to avioid sending the email if the stage has an automatic template set. After the stage changes, this valure returns to false.
#. Add a button "i" in the card kanban view that links directly to the proyect updates.
#. Adds 3 new filters: "Is Task", "Is Sub-Task" & "Parent-Task".
